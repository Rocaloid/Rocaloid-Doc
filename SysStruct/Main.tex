\section{About Rocaloid}\indent

        Rocaloid is a free vocal synthesis \textbf{system}.
        
        Please notice the bold text ``\textbf{system}", which differs it from a ``software" or ``application": in a broad sense, Rocaloid provides a series of tools and libraries from the very basic DSP libs to synthesis engine and musical score editor. In a narrow sense, what Rocaloid represents in this reference is the back-end of this system.

\subsection{Purpose}\indent

        Rocaloid aims at singing voice synthesis rather than speech synthesis(though it is possible to be used as a speech synthesizer).
        
        The description for history of Rocaloid Project can be found on our website:

\subsection{Values}\indent

        In the back-end of Rocaloid, we code everything from scratch. The author Sleepwalking himself is a pure enthusiast in voice signal processing and he does not really care about development cycle.

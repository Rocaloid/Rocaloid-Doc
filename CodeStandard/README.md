Language: C

Version 0, Revision 1

---

1. Preliminaries
---

###1.1 About

This standard instructs collaborators to contribute high-quality codes to Rocaloid, and helps them better understand others' works within Rocaloid Project.

The scope of this standard applies to all **codes written in C** in Rocaloid Project, excluding those in the front end.

####1.1.1 About this Revision

* 1.2: Add definition of Object.
* 3.1: Add Object Identifier.
* 3.1.9: Add definition of Object Name.
* 3.3: Avoiding underlines.
* Exchange chapter 4 and 5.
* 4: Add additional language standards.

###1.2 Definitions

* `Component`: refers to the source code of a library or executable.
* `User`: refers to anyone who utilize components under Rocaloid Project.
* `Contributor`: refers to anyone who contribute codes to Rocaloid Project.
* `Class`: refers to a structure declared by `RClass` of RUtil2.
* `Interface`: refers to any **standard formed by codes that contributors and users share** within the published codes.
* `Word`: a chain of characters that follow the Upper Camel Case naming method.
* `Object`: region of data storage in the execution environment, the contents of which can represent values. (WG14/n1256)

2. Format
---

###2.1 File Extension

* Headers should have `.h` file extension.
* RTemplate headers should have `.h` file extension and `_` prefix.
* Sources, except RTemplate sources, should have `.c` file extension.
* RTemplate sources should have `.rc` file extension `_` prefix.
* Natural docs documentations should have `.txt` file extension.
* Other markdown-written documents should have `.md` file extension.

###2.2 Line

* Tabs should be replaced by space. Tab size should be 4 characters.
* Maximum length for a line is 80 characters.
* When the length of a line exceeds 80 characters, the line should be separated and continued in the next line, with an indent of 4 more characters.

####2.2.1 Newline and brackets

**Braces** are separated to be in the next line in the following situations:

* After `if`.
* After `else`.
* After `for`.
* After `while`.
* After `do`.
* After `switch`.

And are not separated when:

* Before `else`.
* Before `while` in `do` blocks.

The separated braces **should not** be indented. But the succedent block items **should** be indented.

####2.2.2 Exceptions

When a block has only one item, its braces should be omitted. But the block items are still indented. The above rules still apply to the items.

###2.3 Spacing

Additional spacing is required **before and after** these punctuators:

`-> *(as multiply) / + - % << >> < > <= >= == != &(as bitwise AND operator) ^ | && || ? : = *= /= %= += -= <<= >>= &= ^= |=`

Additional spacing is required **before but not after** these punctuators:

`++ --`

Additional spacing is required **after but not before** these punctuators:

`, &(as address operator) ~ ! *(as abstract declarator)`

Additional spacing is **not required** before or after these punctuators:

`. [ ] ( ) { } ; # ## *(as indirection operator)`

####2.3.1 Rule of combination

When **one of** the above rules is satisfied, a space should be inserted before or after the punctuator, except when a space(**including indent**) already exists in the target location.

###2.4 Other

The above rules apply to macro definitions.

3. Naming
---

All identifiers follow an extended **Upper Camel Case** naming method.

###3.1 External Identifier

`External Identifier`:

*   `{Annoymous Prefix(opt)}{Namespace Abbreviation}_{Library-Scope Identifier}`

`Library-Scope Identifier`:

*   `{Class Identifier}_{Annoymous Prefix(opt)}{Method Identifier}`

*   `{Annoymous Prefix(opt)}{Function Identifier}`

*   `{Annoymous Prefix(opt)}{Object Identifier}`

`Class Identifier`:

*   `{Class Name}_{Class Architecture(opt)}_{Class Type(opt)}`

`Method/Function Identifier`:

*   `{Function Name}_{Function Architecture(opt)}_{Function Type(opt)}`

`Object Identifier`:

*   `{Object Name}_{Object Architecture(opt)}_{Object Type(opt)}`

`Function Name`:

*   `{Function Prefix(opt)}{Function Core}{Function Postfix(opt)}`

**Namespace Abbreviation should not be used inside RUtil2.**

**Class/Function Architecture and Class/Function Type can either be generated by RTemplate or be manually specified.**

####3.1.1 Annoymous Prefix

Annoymous Prefix is used to hide an identifier from programmers, to prevent naming collision.

An Annoymous Prefix can be either

*   `_`: to hide an identifier from users.
*   `__`: to hide an identifier from both users and contributors of the component itself.

####3.1.2 Namespace Abbreviation

The abbreviation of a namespace, usually shorter than 7 characters and upper case(but not compulsively). A namespace can be the name of a component.

Examples:

*   `CDSP2`: abbr. Cybervoice engine Digital Signal Processing library 2
*   `CSVP`: abbr. Cybervoice engine Spectral Voice Processing library
*   `RFNL`: abbr. Rocaloid Fast Numerical Library

####3.1.3 Class Name

The name of a Class.

Examples:

*   `FWindow`: Fast Window generator(see RFNL/src/FWindow/).
*   `STFTIterlyzer`: STFT iterative analyzer(see CVESVP/src/Iterator/_STFTIterlyzer.h).

####3.1.4 Class Architecture/Function Architecture

The CPU/GPU instruction set that the class/function targets at.

Examples:

*   `Gnrc`: Generic architecture support.
*   `SSE`: SSE instruction set support.

####3.1.5 Class Type/Function Type

The data type(s) that the class/function operates on.

Class Type/Function Types should be words.

When multiple types have to be specified, join them with `_`.

Examples:

*   `Float`.
*   `Float_Double`.

####3.1.6 Function Prefix

When a function/method has variants with different set of parameters or different return types, a Function Prefix is added before the Function Core.

Function Prefix should be an abbreviation that is less than 6 characters and in upper case.

Examples:

*   `V`: Vector operation(see RFNL/src/Vec/).
*   `VC`: Vector operation with one constant argument.
*   `IR`: Inverse Real operation.
*   `FW`: Accepts a pointer to FWindow(see CVEDSP2/src/Container/_Wave.h).

####3.1.7 Function Core

The essence that describes the behaviour of the function.

Examples:

*   `FFT`: Fast Fourier Transform(see RFNL/src/DFT).
*   `Mul`: Multiply(see RFNL/src/Vec).

####3.1.8 Function Postfix

When a function/method has variants with same set of parameters and return types but different internal mechanisms, a Function Postfix is added after the Function Core.

Function Postfix should be an abbreviation that is less than 6 characters and in upper case, or word(s) joined to the Function Core with `_`.

Examples:

*   `_LPrec`: Low Precision(see RFNL/src/FMath/).
*   `W`: Windowed(see CVEDSP2/src/Container/_Wave.h).

####3.1.9 Object Name

The name of an object.

###3.2 Function Parameters

* Always use `Dest` to represent the data destination of an operation.
* Always use `Sorc` to represent the data source of an operation.
* Always use `Size` instead of `Length`.
* When multiple destinations or sources have to be specified, add numbers after them. e.g. `Dest1`, `Dest2` ...
* When conjuate destinations or sources or other parameters have to be specified, add postfixes after them, 4 characters long is preferred. e.g. `SorcReal`, `SorcImag`.

###3.3 Other

The above rules apply to macro definitions.

`_` in Function Cores, Object Names, and Class Names should be avoided, **if possible**.

4. Language
---

The C programming language standard for Rocaloid Project is ISO/IEC 9899:1999, with the additional restrictions:

* Type qualifiers(`const`, `restrict`, and `volatile`) should never be used.

###4.1 Scope-specific Standard

* `register` specifiers should never be used, except in RFNL.
* `volatile` qualifiers can be used in RFNL.

5. Interface
---

###5.1 Class

###5.2 Functions

* For methods, the first parameters should always be "pointer to Class".
* For other functions, the first parameters should always be the destination of operation, except when their results are returned.
* In the following parameters, sources of operation should have the highest priority.
* **Do not** use `Dest` or `Sorc` to represent data with non pointer data types.
* Functions are not recommended to return a pointer. If so, their Function Cores or Function Prefixes should contain `Alloc` or `AL`.
